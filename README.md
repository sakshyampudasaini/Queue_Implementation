# Queue_Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates a basic implementation of a **Queue** data structure using a command-line interface (CLI).

- Dequeue elements from the front of the queue  
- View the front element without removing it  
- View the rear element without removing it  
- Display all elements in the queue  
- Exit the program  

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `queue.py` file.  
2. Run the program with the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
3. Follow the on-screen menu and input numbers to perform queue operations.
